## Overview

This is a project, inspired by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com). I created this project partly by the usefulness of the Go by Example site, and partly to come back to common code snippets used in common frontend development. I really enjoyed [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), but I'm lazy when it comes to finding code examples in the chapters. Hopefully this project will be a faster search endpoint.
